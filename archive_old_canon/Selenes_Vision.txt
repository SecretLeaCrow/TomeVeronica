I see him striking down demons, and I haven't comprehension of what it means.

He is like a tempest, rising as Icarus, defiant of our masters.

No, not rising, falling, struck down by thunder.

Falling, tumbling, aghast in anguish.

And yet he plummets, not in hatred or free fall, but in determined pull towards the earth.

I reach out to save him, to tug upon puppeteering threads to hoist him up.

Only to realize I am there with him, and beside him, and below him.

I am falling, I have not the wings, and he is falling towards me, for me.

He outstretches his hand and grasps me.

He hovers with me in hand, and looks to me, and I at him.

He utters my name.

His voice does not speak alone.

From around me are figures watching, lifting me in song, the familial and familiar.

As he of the sky looks with angel eyes, and his face I have not known, yet still I know.

"Go!" the voices seem to say, ascending a chorus.

"Go!" they say, as he hoists me from the earth.

And here he has just begun.

As now he rises, plummeting no longer.

And he thrusts himself skyward, ascendant in triumph.

And I cling to him, and hope not to weigh him down.

As here he rises.

As foretold.

As seen in my eyes.

For they are the chosen, the demigod, the bringer, the select, the successor.

Do you not know your own image, hero?

This is you.
